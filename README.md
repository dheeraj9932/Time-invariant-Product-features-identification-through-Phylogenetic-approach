# Time invariant Product features identification through Phylogenetic approach

## Short description of the project:
The aim of the research is to perform feasibility research on the possibility of using Phylogenetic algorithms which are used in the field of Biology and Biotechnology to identify the relationships between organisms and species. The area of application at hand is to identify a way to utilise only set of surface features like surface reflectance property of a product/an object that can be used to Uniquelyand reliably identify and distinguish a product/object.
